SymbolSets: A list containing all the symbols (the vocabulary without blank)

y_probs: Numpy array with shape (# of symbols + 1, Seq_length, batch_size)
         Your batch size for part 1 will remain 1, but if you plan to use your
         implementation for part 2 you need to incorporate batch_size.

Return the forward probability of the greedy path (a float) and
the corresponding compressed symbol sequence i.e. without blanks
or repeated symbols (a string).

BeamWidth: Width of the beam.

The function should return the symbol sequence with the best path score
(forward probability) and a dictionary of all the final merged paths with
their scores.
